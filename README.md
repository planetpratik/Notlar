Notlar - An Android App

This is the project i've created along with my group during 3rd year of Engineering as Mini Project

I've leared GitHub after completion of this app so you will not find step by step commits from first version.
I've directly uploaded final version of the app.

This was my first android app.. created while learning "Sunshine - Udacity" app course.
It's incomplete. only few modules work.

Hope that it will help to someone who is new to android programming and want to try something new.
